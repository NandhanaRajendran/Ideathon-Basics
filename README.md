# 🌐 Team Web Pages – Git Collaboration Trial

Welcome! This repository is a **trial project** where we practiced how to clone a repository, create individual folders, and collaborate using Git and GitHub.
Each member has a personal folder with their own `index.html`, and a central homepage provides navigation through interactive buttons.

## 🚀 Live Preview
🌟 This project is hosted on both **GitHub Pages** and **Netlify**.

> Navigate to each page using the buttons on the main homepage.
